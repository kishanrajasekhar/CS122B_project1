# Project 1 

This project uses a movie domain and Java to connect to a SQL database and serves query + update requests from the users. We also used Eclipse to compile and run our program

## Installation

Create a project1.sql file which initializes and creates the movie database
Populate the database with the data.sql file 
Download MySQL-connector-java-5.1.4.1-bin.jar file and add it to the CLASSPATH. (Sidenote: if you are using Eclipse, you can use the Add External Jar option) 
You are finished! Now Java can connect to the database.
